= Bookmarks

For those who use multiple browsers, synching browser bookmarks
is not an option.

This Flutter project is part of Ian's Bookmarks scheme.
Hopefully it will someday interact with a datastore backend.

== Status

**INCOMPLETE**

At present the main invokes the EditPage directly;
the EditPage can also be started if any other app does a "Share"
of a web link.

There is a start of a list-based main page that will
invoke the Edit page from the FAB (for new) or on
list long-press (for edit existing).

A future version will have a local database,
synched either with Ian's Java-based backend or with FireBase.

And there'll have to be a settings page for the
server info and other options.
