= Bookmarks

For those who use multiple browsers, synching browser bookmarks
is not a convenient option.

This Flutter project is part of Ian's Bookmarks scheme.

== Status

**Note:** At present this is a demo only, and while the UI
works for some domains of "works", there is NO OFFSITE
STORAGE so please don't spend time typing URLs in here;
you could lose all your work by uninstall/reinstall
(or by losing your device, of course).

There are two main pages so far:

* ListPage - main - start of a list-based main page that will
** launch a browser if you tap on a URL;
** invoke the Add page from the FAB
* EditPage - page for editing a bookmark.

The EditPage can be started when any other app does a "Share"
of a web link and you choose to open with Bookmarks,
even if the app isn't running. This works thanks to the
_receive_sharing_intent_ plugin from _pub.dev_.

ListPage needs Category restriction dropdown, and Search.
Some of these lists will become long over time.

ListPage should also handle long press on a bookmark, with a popup menu
for edit, delete (any other?).

A future version will have teh local database backed,
either with Ian's Java-based backend or with FireBase.

And there'll need to be a settings page for:

* the server info (host, port, path)
* A login screen for username + password?
* Add Category
