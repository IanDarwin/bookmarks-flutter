= Bookmarks

For those who use multiple browsers, synching browser bookmarks
is not an option.

This Flutter project is part of Ian's Bookmarks scheme.
Hopefully it will someday interact with a datastore backend.

== Status

At present the main invokes the EditPage directly.
It can also be started if any other app does a "Share"
of a web link.

A future version will have a local database,
synched either with Ian's Java-based backend or with FireBase.
